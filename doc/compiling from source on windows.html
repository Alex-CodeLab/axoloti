<h1>Compiling from source on Windows</h1>
        <h2>Get the gnu arm compiler, build tools and dfu-util</h2>
        Automated by running the shell script "platform_win\get_dependencies.sh" from the MinGW shell.
        If you don't want to install MinGW, open the shell script in a text editor and do everything by hand...
        <h2>Install Java</h2>
        To compile from source, you need Java JDK, and Ant.
        I recommend downloading the Netbeans bundle with Java SE from here: 
        https://netbeans.org/downloads        
        <h2>Compiling the Axoloti GUI</h2>
        Open the project in NetBeans, go to the "Run" menu, and select "Build Project". <p>
        Or alternatively, launch the batch file "compile_gui.bat" in the "platform_win" directory.
