TODO: fix installer (build.xml) : building runtimes, cleanup paths for runtime, api, env
	goal:
		* test-env.mk should trap installation issues
		* a fat directory containing all could run on all platforms without installing
	strategy: 
		* runtimes: only large stuff (perhaps really only arm-none-eabi-gcc)
		* installer: include small binaries (if installer does not prevent executing them...)
