just a test module

still lots to do....

- makefile needs to be easy to generate, probably just a list of source files, and the module name
- common 'rules' will hopefully move into an included makefile (alongside makefile.patch) (makefile.module?)
- a C program will generate the redefine symbol file, given the symbol file generated by nm

basically this is adding a namespace
_ZN(len) 
e.g. for a namespace of atest, go from 
_ZN4func 
to 
_ZN5atest4func

note: see how we move the ZN, but we need to keep the len of the existing symbol
this works for things in a namespace, or global


testing:
important thing to test is statics!

note: nm -g reports exported symbols only .. I think this (hopefully) will include static
